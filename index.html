        <p>Hi! I'm Carlos, a Software Engineer.</p>

          This project was assigned by the Codecademy Fullstack Engineer
          Career Path Course. The purpose of the project was to build a
          responsive group page for a fictional social club. This webpage is
          mobile friendly, responsive to page resizing, and can be seen
          <a href="https://carlos-muniz.github.io/halloween-club/" target="_blank">here</a>.

        <p>
          My main professional interests are in technologies for Education. I
          believe that education is extremely important, and opportunities to
          learn should be plentiful and inexpensive. I also believe that
          technology can be used to bring a higher quality of education to
          anyone that may want it.
        </p>
        <p>
          My technical interests are in Free & Open Source Software. While I
          understand the need for proprietary software, I believe that sharing
          source code is beneficial to a free and competitive economy. I am a
          big fan of Linux and other open source technologies.
        </p>
        <p>
          My personal interests are in PC Gaming and Exercise. You can see
          what games I've been playing
