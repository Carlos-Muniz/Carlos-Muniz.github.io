        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi! I'm Carlos, a Software Engineer.</p>
        <p>
          I studied Physics (B.S.) and Mathematics (B.A.) at the University of Florida, and took some Computer Science
          courses as electives. After taking these courses I became interested in STEM Education, and in my final year
          at UF, I researched the Help-Seeking Behavior in Educational Video Games. In 2017, I started a PhD in Computer
          Science at Rutgers University. While there I researched Hierarchical Simulation of Social Media Networks and
          Multi-turn Open-Domain Conversational Agents. In 2020, I passed my qualifying exam, and exited the PhD program
          with a Master of Science in Computer Science.
        </p>
        <p>
          With the M.S. and 3 years of research experience, I took a position as a Software Engineer at Systems &
          Technology Research that would allow me to get my bearings outside of Academia. After learning much and
          working with terrific scientists and engineers, I left that position to once again pursue my technical and
          professional interests in my current position as an Open Source Software Engineer for edX.

      <h2>Interests</h2>
      <p>
        My professional interests are in technologies for education. I
        believe that education is extremely important, and opportunities to
        learn should be plentiful and inexpensive. I also believe that
        technology can be used to bring higher quality education to
        anyone that may want it.
      </p>
      <p>
        My technical interests are in Free & Open Source Software. While I
        understand the need for proprietary software, I believe that sharing
        source code is beneficial to a free and competitive economy. I am a
        big fan and user of Linux, VLC Media Player, and Bitwarden.
      </p>
      <p>
        My personal interests are in Tinkering, PC Gaming and Exercise. I'm currently tinkering with a Raspberry Pi 3B+.
